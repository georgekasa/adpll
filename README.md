This repository aims to create a time-domain ADPLL model based on the book All-Digital Frequency Synthesizer in Deep-Submicron CMOS by Robert Bogdan Staszewski & Balsara.

I believe the rapid acceleration of AI is largely due to the contributions of the open-source community. In this spirit, I have uploaded this repository to GitHub.
If you find any bugs or errors, please open an issue to fix it.

Thank you in advance
